Alright, so I'm trying to plan everything out right now.

I've just stumbled upon something possibly game-changing: 1-minute realtime observational data.

I think I'm gonna use this data from NCEI to train my model, but to do that I need to train it on
historical 1-minute data. I'm gonna try and see where I can find this.


I've also been thinking on what exactly the process should look like for me to build this ML model. I
was thinking something like this:

1. Data gathering and parsing
   2. Find a good source
   3. Feature engineer, add forecasted highs
   4. Train ML model
   5. Validate on a certain dataset
   6. Retrain on whole dataset
2. Front-end execution
   3. Get realtime data sources
   4. Feed into ML model
   5. Make faux trades on Kalshi
   6. Backtest
3. Deploy it and make get dat bag!!!


Ok, it's a lot easier said than done. And with this new data source, I'm gonna have to start at square
one again. I'm about to leave for China, but my flight's at 6:00 am so we're leaving at 3:30 am. It's
11:46 PM right now, and I was gonna wake up at 3:30 am, so I think I might just pull an all-nighter
tonight so I can adjust to the jetlag better anyway. See you then, future Tony!
