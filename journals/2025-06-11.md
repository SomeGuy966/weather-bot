So I think my goal for today is just to parse the NYC data.

Ok, wait. I feel like I need to make a list of things that I have to do before I can start doing things.

So the work flow is gonna look something like this. I'm just gonna lay out what I need to do for
New York right now

1. Parse the data for just New York for now
   2. Gather data for historical temperature highs (and at what time they hit)
2. Create a model to predict probability buckets just for that city
3. Figure out how to price risk and what's a good entry/exit strategy (This one is pretty hard)
4. Once the backtesting passes, deploy that model just to New York
5. Then, repeat the process for all cities
4. Parse the data 



Features to add
1. Own daily high temperature so far
